# Meshtastic-LLM
A super simple interface to allow meshtastic nodes to run a basic LLM chat interface.

See the full project specification in project-spec.md.

## Diagnostics and prompts

The `prompts/` directory contains an append-only `prompts.csv` plus one Markdown file per prompt (with YAML front matter) so the repository can be rendered by Jekyll/GitHub Pages for oversight and demonstrations.
